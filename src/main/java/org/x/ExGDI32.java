	 * @param pwszDriver A pointer to a null-terminated character string that
	 *            specifies either DISPLAY or the name of a specific display
	 *            device. For printing, we recommend that you pass NULL to
	 *            lpszDriver because GDI ignores lpszDriver for printer devices.
	 * @param pwszDevice A pointer to a null-terminated character string that
	 *            specifies the name of the specific output device being used,
	 *            as shown by the Print Manager (for example, Epson FX-80). It
	 *            is not the printer model name. The lpszDevice parameter must
	 *            be used.
	 * @param pszPort This parameter is ignored and should be set to NULL. It is
	 *            provided only for compatibility with 16-bit Windows.
	 * @param pdm A pointer to a DEVMODE structure containing device-specific
	 *            initialization data for the device driver. The
	 *            DocumentProperties function retrieves this structure filled in
	 *            for a specified device. The pdm parameter must be NULL if the
	 *            device driver is to use the default initialization (if any)
	 *            specified by the user.
	 * 
	 *            If lpszDriver is DISPLAY, pdm must be NULL; GDI then uses the
	 *            display device's current DEVMODE.
	 * @return If the function succeeds, the return value is the handle to a DC
	 *         for the specified device.
	 * 
	 *         If the function fails, the return value is NULL.
